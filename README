This implementation is a learning exercise in Spring and Core for me. It is designed to try to leverage 3-tier capabilities, and the overall architecture may or may not be what would be done without having that as a goal.

Also, I am experimenting with making user actions durable immediately instead of having to activate a Save button.

A relational DBMS is used (PostgreSQL), and that is a bit of overkill in terms of what a small program like this needs, but again, it is more of a learning exercise than something like a commercial work.
